# View Documentation

## Overview

The View component in this MVP implementation is responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing user interactions. It has no direct knowledge of the business logic and delegates all user actions to the Presenter.

## Components

### ICounterView Interface

`ICounterView` defines the contract for the counter view with the following methods:

```java
public interface ICounterView {
    void setPresenter(ICounterPresenter presenter);  // Sets the presenter for this view
    void updateCounter(int value);                   // Updates the displayed counter value
    void show();                                     // Displays the view
}
```

### CounterViewImpl Implementation

`CounterViewImpl` is the concrete JavaFX implementation of the `ICounterView` interface:

```java
public class CounterViewImpl extends Application implements ICounterView {
    private ICounterPresenter presenter;
    private Label counterLabel;

    @Override
    public void setPresenter(ICounterPresenter presenter) {
        this.presenter = presenter;
    }

    @Override
    public void updateCounter(int value) {
        if (counterLabel != null) {
            counterLabel.setText("Counter: " + value);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void show() {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // UI initialization and event handling
        counterLabel = new Label("Counter: 0");
        Button incrementButton = new Button("Increment");
        Button resetButton = new Button("Reset");

        // Event handling delegated to the presenter
        incrementButton.setOnAction(e -> presenter.onIncrement());
        resetButton.setOnAction(e -> presenter.onReset());

        // UI layout and display
        VBox root = new VBox(10, counterLabel, incrementButton, resetButton);
        root.setPadding(new Insets(20));
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 250, 150);
        primaryStage.setTitle("MVP Counter Example");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }
}
```

## Responsibilities

The View is responsible for:

1. **UI Display**: Rendering the counter value and providing buttons for user interaction.
2. **Event Capturing**: Detecting user actions (button clicks).
3. **Delegating Events**: Forwarding user actions to the Presenter without processing them.
4. **Passive Updates**: Receiving updates from the Presenter to reflect changes in the UI.

## Design Considerations

- The View is implemented using JavaFX, but the interface could support other UI frameworks.
- The View follows the "Passive View" approach in MVP:
  - It has no knowledge of the Model
  - It performs minimal processing or business logic
  - It delegates all user actions to the Presenter
  - It provides methods for the Presenter to update the UI
- The View only communicates with the Presenter through the `ICounterPresenter` interface, allowing for loose coupling.
- Event handling is implemented using JavaFX's event system, but the actual processing is delegated to the Presenter.

## Implementation Details

- **JavaFX Integration**: The View extends JavaFX's `Application` class while implementing the `ICounterView` interface.
- **UI Components**:
  - `Label` for displaying the counter value
  - `Button` for incrementing the counter
  - `Button` for resetting the counter
  - `VBox` for layout arrangement
- **Event Handling**: Lambda expressions are used to forward user actions to the Presenter.
- **Error Handling**: The View checks for null references and validates that the Presenter is set before starting.

## Potential Enhancements

- Add styling and improved UI design
- Implement animation for counter changes
- Add accessibility features
- Support for internationalization
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
